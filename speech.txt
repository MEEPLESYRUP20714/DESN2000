problem statement introduction:

the united nations SDG calls for the avaliability and sustainale management of water and sanitation for all, to ensure this
 a reformation in agricultural water usage is necessary in the coming future. Given thet 70 of the fresh water reserve is utlised for irrigation 
 alone, managing the efficent use of water is crucial to sustain  as a reliable resource for all.  
 As of 2019, 52% of all irrigation has been listed as unsustainble due to their continual depletion of basins, aquifiers and lakes. 
 These poor practices are largely contrbuted by that have normalised flood based irrigation methods, causing ongoing 
 issues of water scarcity to a multiude of nations particular affecting, China and India. which will be focused on for this particular prohject 
 
 
 Particuarly focusing on the Xingjiang region of China, the geography of this province have proven to be a challeneging impedement in terms
 of water management, . Making up around 1/6 of the land mass of China, it however only contains 4% of the nations fresh water reserve. 

 The ongoing trends of data procliams that in 30 years time 
geo-socio-polital impacting many stakeholders, indulsing but not limited to the following:
- The Chinese federal government, specifically their budget reconsiderations in order to execute the South North Water 
transportation project to combat this
- Industrial agrioculturalist - will not have enough water to support the wheat and cotton industry 
- Participants in the global cotton markert: with Xinjiang being one of the largest exports of cotton, industries who are
invovled with this trade may face supply issues leading to product inflation 
- The urban residents of Xinjiang will feel economical stagnation if the main industry of the region cannot be support, coupled with 
humans primal need for water, (projected by scientist) the population of Xingjiangs demands for water will not be met as soon 30 years
time 
Thus in order to sustain both industrial agriculturism and the growing demands of urbanisation, the water irrigation model of
Xinjiang would have to be be imporved to prioritise efficency. 

To address these challenges I propose the introduction of a new irrigation method that prioritises the mitigation of water consumption.
Taking the form of an underground irrigation, the principal behind the innovation is to decrease water expenditure through the prevention of water loss through
run off and evaporation.
