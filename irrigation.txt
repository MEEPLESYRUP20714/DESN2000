Underground irrigation system:

SDG6:
Ensure avaliability and sustainable management of water
and sanitation for all 

SDG14:
Conserve and sustainbaly use the oceans, seas and marine resources for
sustainable development 



Problem:
    - Over 70% of the earths fresh water reserved is dedicated towards
    agricultural use, thus the management of such resources is impeccable
    to gauruntee sustaibility
    - 2.4 billion people live in water stressed countries
    - Fertilisation run off damage ocean ecosystems affecting the biodiversity
    of ocean life: specific exam seaweed over growth ~ expand into this later
    - SDG 11 and 6 are both impacted
    - percolation 
    - call for automation in the agricultural indusrty
    
Customer needs:
    - irrigation system that is reuseable for crops 
    - minimise water usage 
    - mitigate runoff 
    - easily operatble 
    - automatic and self sustaining 
    - afforable or at least jutifiable ROI
    - moveable and adjustable to changing water sources 
    - sustainable and cheap power source for the pump 
    - adjustable water amount as well as application time 
    - avoid percolation
    - potential cutomers - farmers direct but indirectly grocery shops and grocery buyers 
    

functional requirement:
    - use of a microcontroller to to determine drip
    - corrosion proof materials to maximise logevity of product 
    - underwater drip system that mitigates water evaporation before absorption 
    since it has the high plant absopbtion percentage when done correctedly 70-95%

Concept presentation:
    - underground irrigation system combined wwith moissture sensor 
    - pressurised enabling capabilities of drip irrigations
