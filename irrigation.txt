Underground irrigation system:

SDG6:
Ensure avaliability and sustainable management of water
and sanitation for all 

SDG14:
Conserve and sustainbaly use the oceans, seas and marine resources for
sustainable development 



Problem:
    - Over 70% of the earths fresh water reserved is dedicated towards
    agricultural use, thus the management of such resources is impeccable
    to gauruntee sustaibility
    - 2.4 billion people live in water stressed countries
    - Fertilisation run off damage ocean ecosystems affecting the biodiversity
    of ocean life: specific exam seaweed over growth ~ expand into this later
    - SDG 11 and 6 are both impacted
    - percolation 
    - call for automation in the agricultural indusrty
    
Customer needs:
    - irrigation system that is reuseable for crops 
    - minimise water usage 
    - mitigate runoff 
    - easily operatble 
    - automatic and self sustaining 
    - afforable or at least jutifiable ROI
    - moveable and adjustable to changing water sources 
    - sustainable and cheap power source for the pump 
    - adjustable water amount as well as application time 
    - avoid percolation
    - potential cutomers - farmers direct but indirectly grocery shops and grocery buyers 
    

functional requirement:
    - use of a microcontroller to to determine drip
    - corrosion proof materials to maximise logevity of product 
    - underwater drip system that mitigates water evaporation before absorption 
    since it has the high plant absopbtion percentage when done correctedly 70-95%

Concept presentation:
    - underground irrigation system combined wwith moissture sensor 
    - pressurised enabling capabilities of drip irrigations

1. Local Farmers
Impact: Farmers, especially those growing water-intensive crops like cotton, are directly impacted by water scarcity and poor irrigation practices. They depend on efficient irrigation systems for crop yields and livelihoods.
Interest: They require sustainable and reliable water access for agricultural productivity but are often constrained by outdated or inefficient irrigation methods.
2. Xinjiang Regional Government
Impact: The government plays a central role in water resource management, setting policies for water allocation, irrigation systems, and agricultural planning.
Interest: The regional government is focused on balancing economic growth, food production, and environmental sustainability while addressing water shortages.
3. Central Chinese Government
Impact: The central government provides oversight, sets national policies, and funds large-scale water management projects such as the South-North Water Transfer Project.
Interest: Maintaining economic development in Xinjiang while ensuring political stability and addressing environmental concerns is critical for the national government.
4. Water Resource Management Authorities
Impact: Organizations and departments that manage and distribute Xinjiang’s water resources are responsible for developing irrigation systems and ensuring efficient water use.
Interest: They aim to modernize irrigation infrastructure, improve water-use efficiency, and mitigate the environmental impact of over-extraction and poor practices.
5. Agricultural Corporations
Impact: Large agribusinesses involved in the production and export of cotton, fruits, and other crops have a vested interest in securing reliable irrigation systems to sustain large-scale farming operations.
Interest: These corporations seek to maximize production but may contribute to water overuse if sustainability practices are not enforced.
6. Environmental Organizations
Impact: Environmental groups advocate for sustainable water use, conservation efforts, and the protection of ecosystems affected by water mismanagement.
Interest: These organizations are concerned with the ecological impact of inefficient irrigation, such as groundwater depletion, desertification, and the loss of biodiversity.
7. Local Communities
Impact: People living in rural and urban areas rely on water resources not only for agriculture but also for daily life, sanitation, and local industries.
Interest: Local communities are affected by water shortages, pollution from agricultural runoff, and the socioeconomic consequences of poor water management.
8. Industrial Sector
Impact: Industries in Xinjiang, including mining and manufacturing, depend on water for their operations. Poor irrigation can divert water away from industrial use or lead to increased competition for resources.
Interest: These sectors require sustainable water allocation to ensure continued industrial productivity without exacerbating water scarcity.
9. International Organizations
Impact: International bodies concerned with climate change, sustainable development, and human rights may take an interest in Xinjiang’s water management practices, particularly as they relate to environmental impacts and food security.
Interest: These organizations advocate for sustainable water practices, international cooperation on water resource management, and equitable access to water.
10. Researchers and Academics
Impact: Experts in hydrology, environmental science, and agricultural engineering study the region’s irrigation challenges and propose solutions for improving water efficiency and sustainability.
Interest: Researchers aim to develop innovative irrigation techniques, promote the use of technology in agriculture, and influence policy through evidence-based recommendations.
Each of these stakeholders plays a role in shaping how Xinjiang’s water resources are managed and how irrigation challenges are addressed. Their differing interests can sometimes lead to competing priorities, which makes sustainable solutions complex but critical for the region's future.
